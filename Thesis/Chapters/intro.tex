See \cite{A01} and \cite{ARS03} for more information.

This is the introduction of my sample thesis. Let me just state that
this is a very, very limited introduction to \LaTeX, and I can not
do justice to it through the next few pages.

I recommend reading this .pdf file along with the .tex file open on
the side so that you can compare the pure ASCII text and the final
result after compilation.

\section{A Different Word Processing System} \label{ch:anotherintro}
I highly recommend the booklet ``The Not So Short Introduction to
\LaTeXe{}'' which is free and very well-written. It is available on:

\noindent I refer you to the introduction there.
