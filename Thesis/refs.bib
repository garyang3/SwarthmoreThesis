	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present a new shear estimator for weak-lensing observations that properly accounts for the effects of a realistic point-spread function (PSF). Images of faint galaxies are subject to gravitational shearing, followed by smearing with the instrumental and/or atmospheric PSF. We construct a "finite-resolution shear operator," which when applied to an observed image has the same effect as a gravitational shear applied prior to smearing. This operator allows one to calibrate essentially any shear estimator. We then specialize to the case of weighted second-moment shear estimators. We compute the shear polarizability, which gives the response of an individual galaxy's polarization to a gravitational shear. We then compute the response of the population of galaxies, and thereby construct an optimal weighting scheme for combining shear estimates from galaxies of various shapes, luminosities, and sizes. We define a figure of merit (an inverse shear variance per unit solid angle) that characterizes the quality of image data for shear measurement. The new method is tested with simulated image data. We discuss the correction for anisotropy of the PSF and propose a new technique involving measuring shapes from images that have been convolved with a recircularizing PSF. We draw attention to a hitherto ignored noise-related bias and show how this can be analyzed and corrected for. The analysis here draws heavily on the properties of real PSFs, and we include in Appendix A a brief review, highlighting those aspects that are relevant for weak lensing.}

It is argued that such an approach should be optimal, allowing measurement with maximal signal-to-noise ratio, coupled with estimation of measurement errors. The distinction between likelihood-based and Bayesian methods is discussed. Systematic biases in the Bayesian method may be evaluated as part of the fitting process, and overall such an approach should yield unbiased shear estimation without requiring external calibration from simulations. The principal disadvantage of model fitting for large surveys is the computational time required, but here an algorithm is presented that enables large surveys to be analysed in feasible computation times. The method and algorithm is tested on simulated galaxies from the Shear TEsting Programme (STEP).}",

        Summary. We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable
        selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the
        elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar
        sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a
        grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or
        out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when
        the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of
        observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory
        variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS‐EN
        is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently,
        much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.

    abstract = "{Mapping the underlying density field, including non-visible dark matter, using weak gravitational lensing measurements is now a standard tool in cosmology. Due to its importance to the science results of current and upcoming surveys, the quality of the convergence reconstruction methods should be well understood. We compare three methods: Kaiser–Squires (KS), Wiener filter, and Glimpse. Kaiser–Squires is a direct inversion, not accounting for survey masks or noise. The Wiener filter is well-motivated for Gaussian density fields in a Bayesian framework. Glimpse uses sparsity, aiming to reconstruct non-linearities in the density field. We compare these methods with several tests using public Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data and realistic DES simulations. The Wiener filter and Glimpse offer substantial improvements over smoothed Kaiser–Squires with a range of metrics. Both the Wiener filter and Glimpse convergence reconstructions show a 12 per cent improvement in Pearson correlation with the underlying truth from simulations. To compare the mapping methods’ abilities to find mass peaks, we measure the difference between peak counts from simulated ΛCDM shear catalogues and catalogues with no mass fluctuations (a standard data vector when inferring cosmology from peak statistics); the maximum signal-to-noise of these peak statistics is increased by a factor of 3.5 for the Wiener filter and 9 for Glimpse. With simulations, we measure the reconstruction of the harmonic phases; the phase residuals’ concentration is improved 17 per cent by Glimpse and 18 per cent by the Wiener filter. The correlationbetween reconstructions from data and foreground redMaPPer clusters is increased 18 per cent by the Wiener filter and 32 per cent by Glimpse.}",
