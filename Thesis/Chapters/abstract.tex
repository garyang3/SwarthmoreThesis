\begin{enumerate}
\item cosmology basics... $\Lambda CDM$. A little bit of FDR metric...
\item Dark Matter halos. virialization... growth of perturbations. Different kinds of dark matter halo. Describe very briefly different dark matter prediction of dark matter halo profiles.
\item Weak lensing basics. Some Newtonian/GR level calculation. What can the weak lensing probe about our universe. 
\item Weak lensing systematics. This is the part I am worst at.. I will need to ask Yoshida about whether to write about it. Weak lensing noise is something I definitely should mention. 
\item Sparsity analysis
\item 3d mass reconstruction (including a mention of other reconstruction research). 
\item results?
