I wish to first give my heartfelt gratitude toward the Department of the Physics and Astronomy for hosting the honors program and provide me this opportunity to summarize my work in weak lensing cosmology. It has been truly a satisfying process.
My thanks also goes to Professor Tristan Smith for setting up this project with Professor Naoki Yoshida, who offered me a wonderful journel of cosmology. 
Also, I wish mention my collaborator and friend Xiangchong Li from Carnegie Mellon University who helped me not only with this project but various aspect on physics. 
I appreciate the help also of my two other research advisors, Peter Collings and Michael Brown, for supporting my thesis in their own way. 
Finally, I wish to thank my partner Meihan ``Della'' Guo, who, though not contributing scientifically, provided me emotional support that have gotten me through the project.
